It arose as a discipline distinct from philosophy in the late 19th century.\\nThe mind is so complex and so dynamic—it is changing as you read these words—and so much of its information processing happens below the level of conscious awareness that experts have long struggled to understand its functions and dysfunctions.\\nIn addition, human behavior is so varied that psychology extends its reach into many areas of activity. In general, research psychologists are those who study the many operations of the mind. Those who treat the dysfunctions are clinical psychologists, while many other experts in psychology apply their knowledge of human behavior in fields ranging from economics to sports to hospital design.\\nBoth to understand human nature and to help troubled individuals resolve their dilemmas, psychology attempts to gauge the relative influence of internal forces and outside forces in shaping every act of behavior. The internal influences that come under consideration range from genes and temperament, or the tenor of the nervous system, to beliefs, memories, values, and feelings.\\nRelationships, experience, and the nature of one’s surroundings are some external factors known to influence us from the outside in and shape individual and group behavior, often in ways that elude awareness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n            What Are Basic Psychological Processes?\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychology’s provenance is not only huge but it focuses most on those elements that give human experience its richness. Its major interests include:\\n• Emotions from affection to guilt to revenge, and all the other feelings that stir human behavior\\n• Perception, the awareness that operates through our five senses\\n• Memory, the repository of experience, ours to summon up at will\\n• Learning, the knowledge and skills we acquire and store in memory for use as needed\\n• Cognition, the mental processes involved in understanding the world and everything in it\\n• Motivation, all the desires and drives that fuel human action and behavior, whether the goal is personal growth or connection or a day at the beach\\n• Dreaming, the dramas unfolding in our heads while we sleep\\n• The self, that sense you have of being the coherent organizer of your mental and physical life\\n• Personality, the more or less consistent ways in which individuals tend to think, feel, and act\\n• Distress, from depression to obsession, from heartbreak to phobias, from addiction to lack of confidence, the many forms of human suffering that, however temporary, can impair functioning\\n• And, of course, the brain and nervous system that orchestrates it all.\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nHow Emotions Guide Our Lives\\n\\n\\nYour Emotions Are Not \"Things\" in Your Brain\\n\\n\\nDo Dreams Really Mean Anything?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\narticle continues after advertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n            What Are Basic Principles of Psychology?\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKnowledge of the complexities of the mind’s operations is constantly evolving as new tools become available to literally see inside the mind or indirectly assess its workings. Still, some principles of behavior are well-established:\\n• The preeminent goal of any organism is to stay alive. To that end, the brain functions as a prediction machine, constantly scanning the environment for clues to what will come next, so an individual can exert some means of control and stay safe.\\n• In its preference for certainty over uncertainty (which makes us feel uncomfortable and anxious), the mind seeks to detect patterns—and it’s sometimes too good at it, seeing them where they don’t exist.\\n• No one knows for sure yet how consciousness—our awareness of ourselves and the world around us—arises from the 3 scant pounds of tissue in our heads, but all evidence indicates the mind operates on two parallel tracks: one by which we gather information consciously, through intentionally focusing attention, and another that gathers information automatically, outside of conscious awareness. Both contribute to attitudes, beliefs, decision-making, and behavior.\\n• People tend to resist change because it creates uncertainty, at least at first.\\n• Sleep is essential not only for physical health and development but for maintenance of psychological functioning. It enables debris clearance from brain cells, establishment of long-term memories, and synchronization of body systems, which helps keep the mind on track.\\n• The mind is built for social experience, and isolation undermines mental stability.\\n• Development occurs over the entire lifespan, as the brain generates new neurons and connections between neurons in response to exercise, mental stimulation, and a nutrient-rich diet.\\n• Reproduction is so essential for survival of the species that much mental activity and behavior related to sex is preprogrammed into the nervous system to serve this need.\\n• The mind can get stuck in a number of ways and cause significant distress to self and others.\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n            Six Simple Brain Principles\\n      \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n            Three Useful Principles for Life\\n      \\n          \\n\\n\\nLaws of Human Behavior\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n            Principles for Decision-Making\\n      \\n          \\n\\n\\n3 Ways to Explain Human Behavior\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n            What Are Some Key Findings of Psychology?\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the foundational discoveries of psychology is the conditioned response, which underlies all learning—the means by which we adapt to our environments. In studies that won him the Nobel Prize in 1904, Ivan Pavlov demonstrated that when a tone (and later other sounds and other stimuli) is sounded at the same time food is presented, a dog will eventually salivate at the sound alone, because the animal comes to associate the sound with the arrival of food. The studies are noteworthy to this day not just because they reveal a basic form of learning but also because they demonstrate how invisible mental processes can be studied and measured.\\nSince then, psychologists have shown that:\\n• Attachment to a caregiver in infancy and early childhood heavily influences an individual’s ability to reach optimal cognitive, emotional, and social development as an adult. \\n• Intelligence is a general mental capacity that operates in many spheres of life.\\n• Decision-making and attitudes are subject to many biases. Chief among them is the tendency to overestimate how much we, rather than situations or environments, are responsible for the outcome of an event—the fundamental attribution error.\\n• Depression arises in large part because the brain has a built-in bias toward negative information, which registers faster, more strongly, and more enduringly than positive information. Prioritizing the speedy detection of danger, this so-called negativity bias likely developed to keep us out of harm’s way, although it explains why a word of criticism has so much staying power and negative political advertising is effective. \\n• Learned helplessness is a sense of futility that develops after the failure of many efforts to escape a negative, uncontrollable situation. Even if the negative stimulus ends, people often retain the belief that nothing they do can make a difference, and they stop trying.\\n• Memory is not an indelible snapshot of events but a malleable recollection of events. Memories typically undergo revision every time we summon them up and recount them, then return them to storage.\\n• Stereotypes are important shortcuts in thinking but they have downsides—they also contribute to development of prejudice.\\n• Groupthink occurs when well intentioned people make horrible decisions as a group. Individuals stifle dissent in order to maintain group harmony or gain the approval of others. Groupthink is said to be responsible for the Vietnam War, the Challenger space-shuttle disaster, and media reporting during the 2016 election.\\n• Stress, or challenge, is a necessary condition for growth and adaptation; chronic stress is a different matter, constricting people physically and emotionally, and requiring any of many strategies to nullify its harmful effects.\\n• Adolescence and young adulthood are prime times for psychological distress to manifest itself. Because humans can do well in a wide array of situations; children automatically make adaptations to their early rearing environment that may serve them less well as they move out into the wider world.\\n• Neuroplasticity, the capacity of brain/mind to reshape itself in response to experience, is a basic characteristic of the human nervous system, and it means that change is always possible.\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nHow the Unconscious Works\\n\\n\\nChange Artists\\n\\n\\nHow Negative News Distorts Our Thinking\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n            The Value of Stress\\n      \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n            What Is Clinical Psychology?\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClinical psychology applies the entire, constantly evolving knowledge base of human behavior first and foremost to the relief of emotional suffering of individuals, families, and other groups, and to the desire for growth and change. Whether helping people of all ages cope with severe psychopathology or providing techniques for relieving everyday anxiety, clinical psychologists practice in a wide range of settings, including hospitals, private offices, and schools and colleges.\\nClinical psychologists typically invite from the patient(s) a history of the problem and descriptions of how it impedes functioning. A diagnosis helps the clinician focus treatment and marshal supportive services that may also aid in relieving distress. The goal is almost always to foster understanding of the problem and to provide skills for managing the kinds of experience that disrupt function.\\nThere are many types of therapy aimed at changing thoughts and behaviors that psychologists deploy to help patients restore balance and even grow. A deeply researched and widely used approach today is cognitive behavioral therapy, with or without some form of meditation, to help people overcome their own non-productive patterns of thinking, reacting emotionally, and behaving.\\nResearch has also demonstrated the value of face-to-face interaction—a sine qua non of most psychotherapy—in calming the nervous system and establishing feelings of safety, a necessary condition for people to begin tackling their problems.\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\nShould I Seek Help? \\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n            How Psychotherapists Create Change\\n      \\n          \\n\\n\\nIs There a Science to Psychotherapy? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n            Where Else Is Psychology Used and Applied?\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEducation, particularly from preschool through high school, is heavily influenced by findings from psychology about how children learn, the role of intelligence, the value of testing, and the development of skills such as problem-solving and creativity. Many schools employ psychologists directly to help assess children’s abilities and to resolve problems that show up in the school setting.\\nOrganizations rely on psychology in areas ranging from the selection and training of employees to optimizing productivity to promoting job satisfaction and creating productive work environments. Psychology also provides a foundation of management and leadership programs in most business schools.\\nForensic psychology applies psychological knowledge to legal issues, from law enforcement to criminal investigations to jury selection. The fallibility of eyewitness testimony is one important recent finding of psychology to influence legal proceedings.\\nHigh-stakes performance—whether on the playing field or in the concert hall—attracts psychologists who help highly skilled individuals function under intense pressure. Many sports teams hire psychologists full-time to work with players to maximize performance.\\nThe military utilizes psychology to help troops to prepare for and recover from the stresses of combat, to maintain morale, and to understand enemy strategies. Military psychologists may engage in research as well as practice.\\nThere are many other subfields of psychology. For example, engineering and design of items from homes to telephones increasingly relies on knowledge of ways people interact safely and most productively with their environments. Neuropsychologists specialize in the assessment and, often, the treatment of conditions related to injury to or disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke and ADHD, respectively.\\nEvolutionary psychology is a subfield that applies a unique perspective.

It encompasses the scientific study of the mind and behavior and the application of these principles to help prevent, treat, and diagnose mental health conditions. Psychologists explore both typical and atypical behavior to understand the human experience fully.\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychology plays an important role in helping people live better lives. By learning about the basics of behavior and the human mind, people can gain a greater understanding of themselves and others.\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychologists also play a vital role in health care by caring for individuals experiencing mental health issues, performing psychotherapy, investigating treatment options, and teaching patients how to manage their symptoms effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some people, an interest in psychology is fueled by a desire to pursue a career in the field. Others may simply want to learn more out of curiosity or because they are thinking about consulting a psychologist for help with a health concern.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo matter the reason, building a better understanding of topics such as emotion, motivation, cognition, love, communication, and research methods will serve you well.\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychology may seem like a vast and daunting topic at first, but understanding a few basic facts can make it easier to get started. Once you have a strong understanding of the basics, you will be better prepared to explore different ways that psychology may help improve your everyday life, health, and well-being.\\n\\n\\n   Psychology Is the Study of the Mind and Behavior  \\n\\nPsychology can be defined as the study of mental processes and behavior. The term comes from the Greek words psyche, meaning \"breath, spirit, soul,\" and logia, meaning \"study of.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychology has not always existed as it has today. In fact, it is considered a relatively young discipline, although as the eminent psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus explained, it has a short past but a long history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychology emerged from biology and philosophy and is closely linked to other disciplines including sociology, medicine, linguistics, and anthropology.\\n\\n\\nPsychology has quickly grown to play a tremendous role in the world today. Psychologists are employed in hospitals, mental health clinics, schools, colleges and universities, government agencies, private businesses, and private practices.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey perform a wide variety of tasks and roles ranging from treating mental illness to performing research to influencing public health policy.\\n\\n\\n   Psychology Relies on Scientific Methods  \\n\\nOne of the most common myths about psychology is that it is just \"common sense.\" The problem with this is that psychological research has helped demonstrate that many of the things that we believe are just common sense are actually not true at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor instance, it\\'s become \"common sense\" that smoking cigarettes is dangerous. However, people continue to smoke anyway. Psychology helps us go deeper than common sense and understand why human behavior occurs, as well as how to change it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy challenging some of our misconceptions about how and why people behave as they do, psychologists are able to provide answers that help solve real-world problems.\\n\\n\\nPsychology relies on scientific methods to investigate questions and arrive at conclusions. Using empirical methods, researchers are able to discover relationships between different variables.\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychologists use a range of techniques to study the human mind and behavior, including naturalistic observation, experiments, case studies, and questionnaires.\\n\\n\\n   Psychologists Take Multiple Perspectives  \\n\\nTopics and questions in psychology can be looked at in a number of different ways. Each perspective helps contribute a new level of understanding to a topic. Some of the major perspectives in psychology include:\\n\\n\\n\\nBiological perspective\\nCognitive perspective\\nBehavioral perspective\\nEvolutionary perspective\\nHumanistic perspective\\n\\n\\n\\nImagine, for example, that psychologists are trying to understand the different factors that contribute to bullying.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne researcher might take a biological perspective and look at the role of genetics and the brain. Another might take a behavioral perspective and look at how bullying behaviors are reinforced by the environment. Another might take a social perspective and analyze the impact of group pressure.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo single perspective is right. Each contributes to how we understand a topic and allows researchers to analyze the myriad influences that contribute to certain actions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, they can come up with multi-faceted solutions to combat problematic actions and encourage better outcomes and healthier behaviors.\\n\\n\\n   Psychology Has Subfields  \\n\\nIn addition to many different perspectives, there are many branches of psychology. Psychologists often opt to specialize in a particular area. Some of the biggest subfields within psychology are:\\n\\n\\n\\nClinical psychology: Clinical psychologists provide mental and behavioral health care and often provide consultation to communities, as well as training and education. If you are experiencing emotional or psychological symptoms, you might need a clinical or counseling psychologist.\\nCognitive psychology: This subfield focuses on mental processes such as attention, thinking, language, and memory.\\nDevelopmental psychology: Developmental psychologists study human behavior over a lifespan. If you have a question about whether your child is developing normally, then you might want to ask a developmental psychologist.\\nForensic psychology: Sometimes referred to as \"legal psychology,\" forensic psychology is a branch that focuses on psychological assessment of people who are involved in the legal system. Forensic psychologists must have strong clinical skills.\\nIndustrial-organizational psychology: This branch of psychology addresses the workplace as well as human performance and motivation.\\nPersonality psychology: This subfield of psychology addresses personality and its development, traits, variations, and maladaptive forms (such as personality disorders).\\nSocial psychology: Social psychologists focus on human behavior in a group setting. They study group behaviors such as prejudice, bias, bullying, criminal behavior, and substance use.\\n\\n\\n   Psychology Is More Than Mental Health  \\n\\nWhen you think of psychology, do you envision a therapist jotting down notes as a client recounts childhood experiences?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile therapy is certainly a big part of psychology, it is not the only thing that psychologists do.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, many psychologists don\\'t work in the field of mental health at all. Psychology encompasses other areas including teaching, research, and consulting.\\n\\n\\n\\nMental health is certainly a major area of interest in psychology, but psychologists also do things such as help athletes hone their motivation and mental focus, help design products that are safe and useful, and help businesses understand how to influence consumers.\\n\\n\\n   Psychology Is All Around You  \\n\\nPsychology is not just an academic subject that exists only in classrooms, research labs, and mental health offices. The principles of psychology can be seen all around you in everyday situations.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe television commercials and print ads you see every day rely on psychology to develop marketing messages that influence and persuade people to purchase the advertised products. The websites you visit on a regular basis utilize psychology to understand how people read, use, and interpret online information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPsychology can also play a role in improving your health and well-being. For example, understanding some of the basic principles of behavioral psychology might come in handy if you are trying to break a bad habit and establish new routines.\\n\\n\\nKnowing more about some of the things that motivate behavior can be useful if you are trying to stick to a weight loss plan or exercise regimen. Overcoming phobias, managing stress, improving communication skills, and making better decisions are just a few of the things with which psychology can help.\\n\\n\\n   Psychology Has Many Career Paths  \\n\\nIf your child is experiencing problems at school, you might seek advice from a school psychologist who specializes in helping kids deal with academic, social, emotional, and other issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are concerned about an elderly parent or grandparent, you might want to consult with a developmental psychologist who is specially trained and knowledgeable in issues related to the aging process.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn order to determine which professional is right for your needs, it helps to understand some of the different training and licensing requirements for different specialty areas. If you are trying to select a psychotherapist, it may also be helpful to learn more about which professionals are able to provide therapy services.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are thinking about majoring in psychology, there are many career paths to choose from.

Sentiment analysis systems help companies better understand their customers, deliver stronger customer experiences and improve their brand reputation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Analyst report\\n            \\n\\n                IBM named a leader by Gartner\\n            \\nRead why IBM was named a leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud AI Developer Services report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      Related content\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\nRegister for the white paper on AI governance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Why is sentiment analysis important?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nWith more ways than ever for people to express their feelings online, organizations need powerful tools to monitor what’s being said about them and their products and services in near real time. As companies adopt sentiment analysis and begin using it to analyze more conversations and interactions, it will become easier to identify customer friction points at every stage of the customer journey.\\nDeliver more objective results from customer reviews\\nThe latest artificial intelligence (AI) sentiment analysis tools help companies filter reviews and net promoter scores (NPS) for personal bias and get more objective opinions about their brand, products and services. For example, if a customer expresses a negative opinion along with a positive opinion in a review, a human assessing the review might label it negative before reaching the positive words. AI-enhanced sentiment classification helps sort and classify text in an objective manner, so this doesn’t happen, and both sentiments are reflected. \\xa0\\nAchieve greater scalability of business intelligence programs\\nSentiment analysis enables companies with vast troves of unstructured data to analyze and extract meaningful insights from it quickly and efficiently. With the amount of text generated by customers across digital channels, it’s easy for human teams to get overwhelmed with information. Strong, cloud-based, AI-enhanced customer sentiment analysis tools help organizations deliver business intelligence from their customer data at scale, without expending unnecessary resources.\\nPerform real-time brand reputation monitoring\\nModern enterprises need to respond quickly in a crisis. Opinions expressed on social media, whether true or not, can destroy a brand reputation that took years to build. Robust, AI-enhanced sentiment analysis tools help executives monitor the overall sentiment surrounding their brand so they can spot potential problems and address them swiftly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    How does sentiment analysis work?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nSentiment analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies to train computer software to analyze and interpret text in a way similar to humans. The software uses one of two approaches, rule-based or ML—or a combination of the two known as hybrid. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses; while a rule-based approach can deliver results in near real-time, ML based approaches are more adaptable and can typically handle more complex scenarios.\\nRule-based sentiment analysis\\nIn the rule-based approach, software is trained to classify certain keywords in a block of text based on groups of words, or lexicons, that describe the author’s intent. For example, words in a positive lexicon might include “affordable,” “fast” and “well-made,” while words in a negative lexicon might feature “expensive,” “slow” and “poorly made”. The software then scans the classifier for the words in either the positive or negative lexicon and tallies up a total sentiment score based on the volume of words used and the sentiment score of each category.\\nMachine learning sentiment analysis\\nWith a machine learning (ML) approach, an algorithm is used to train software to gauge sentiment in a block of text using words that appear in the text as well as the order in which they appear. Developers use sentiment analysis algorithms to teach software how to identify emotion in text similarly to the way humans do. ML models continue to “learn” from the data they are fed, hence the name “machine learning”. Here are a few of the most commonly used classification algorithms:\\nLinear regression: A statistics algorithm that describes a value (Y) based on a set of features (X).\\nNaive Bayes: An algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem to categorize words in a block of text.\\nSupport vector machines: A fast and efficient classification algorithm used to solve two-group classification problems.\\nDeep learning (DL): Also known as an artificial neural network, deep learning is an advanced machine learning technique that links together multiple algorithms to mimic human brain function.\\n\\nThe hybrid approach\\nA hybrid approach to text analysis combines both ML and rule-based capabilities to optimize accuracy and speed. While highly accurate, this approach requires more resources, such as time and technical capacity, than the other two.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    What are the different types of sentiment analysis?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the different approaches used to build sentiment analysis tools, there are also different types of sentiment analysis that organizations turn to depending on their needs. The three most popular types, emotion based, fine-grained and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) all rely on the underlying software’s capacity to gauge something called polarity, the overall feeling that is conveyed by a piece of text.\\nGenerally speaking, a text’s polarity can be described as either positive, negative or neutral, but by categorizing the text even further, for example into subgroups such as “extremely positive” or “extremely negative,” some sentiment analysis models can identify more subtle and complex emotions. The polarity of a text is the most commonly used metric for gauging textual emotion and is expressed by the software as a numerical rating on a scale of one to 100. Zero represents a neutral sentiment and 100 represents the most extreme sentiment.\\nHere are the three most widely used types of sentiment analysis:\\nFine-grained (graded)\\nFine-grained, or graded, sentiment analysis is a type of sentiment analysis that groups text into different emotions and the level of emotion being expressed. The emotion is then graded on a scale of zero to 100, similar to the way consumer websites deploy star-ratings to measure customer satisfaction.\\nAspect-based (ABSA)\\nAspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) narrows the scope of what’s being examined in a body of text to a singular aspect of a product, service or customer experience a business wishes to analyze. For example, a budget travel app might use ABSA to understand how intuitive a new user interface is or to gauge the effectiveness of a customer service chatbot. ABSA can help organizations better understand how their products are succeeding or falling short of customer expectations.\\nEmotional detection\\nEmotional detection sentiment analysis seeks to understand the psychological state of the individual behind a body of text, including their frame of mind when they were writing it and their intentions. It is more complex than either fine-grained or ABSA and is typically used to gain a deeper understanding of a person’s motivation or emotional state. Rather than using polarities, like positive, negative or neutral, emotional detection can identify specific emotions in a body of text such as frustration, indifference, restlessness and shock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Sentiment analysis use cases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n                \\n            \\n\\n\\n\\nOrganizations conduct sentiment analysis for a variety of reasons. Here are some of the most popular use cases. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Improving customer support\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nSupport teams use sentiment analysis to deliver more personalized responses to customers that accurately reflect the mood of an interaction. AI-based chatbots that use sentiment analysis can spot problems that need to be escalated quickly and prioritize customers in need of urgent attention. ML algorithms deployed on customer support forums help rank topics by level-of-urgency and can even identify customer feedback that indicates frustration with a particular product or feature. These capabilities help customer support teams process requests faster and more efficiently and improve customer experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Building a stronger brand presence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nBy using sentiment analysis to conduct social media monitoring brands can better understand what is being said about them online and why. For example, is a new product launch going well? Monitoring sales is one way to know, but will only show stakeholders part of the picture. Using sentiment analysis on customer review sites and social media to identify the emotions being expressed about the product will enable a far deeper understanding of how it is landing with customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Conducting market research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nBy turning sentiment analysis tools on the market in general and not just on their own products, organizations can spot trends and identify new opportunities for growth. Maybe a competitor’s new campaign isn’t connecting with its audience the way they expected, or perhaps someone famous has used a product in a social media post increasing demand. Sentiment analysis tools can help spot trends in news articles, online reviews and on social media platforms, and alert decision makers in real time so they can take action.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Challenges of sentiment analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nWhile sentiment analysis and the technologies underpinning it are growing rapidly, it is still a relatively new field. According to “Sentiment Analysis,” by Liu Bing (2020) the term has only been widely used since 2003.1 There is still much to be learned and refined, here are some of the most common drawbacks and challenges.\\nLack of context\\nContext is a critical component for understanding what emotion is being expressed in a block of text and one that frequently causes sentiment analysis tools to make mistakes. On a customer survey, for example, a customer might give two answers to the question: “What did you like about our app?” The first answer might be “functionality” and the second, “UX”. If the question being asked was different, for example, “What didn’t you like about our app?” it changes the meaning of the customer’s response without changing the words themselves. To correct this problem, the algorithm would need to be given the original context of the question the customer was responding to, a time-consuming tactic known as pre or post\\xa0processing.\\nUse of irony and sarcasm\\nRegardless of the level or extent of its training, software has a hard time correctly identifying irony and sarcasm in a body of text. This is because often when someone is being sarcastic or ironic it’s conveyed through their tone of voice or facial expression and there is no discernable difference in the words they’re using. For example, when analyzing the phrase, “Awesome, another thousand-dollar parking ticket—just what I need,” a sentiment analysis tool would likely mistake the nature of the emotion being expressed and label it as positive because of the use of the word “awesome”.\\nNegation\\nNegation is when a negative word is used to convey a reversal of meaning in a sentence. For example, consider the sentence, “I wouldn’t say the shoes were cheap.\" What’s being expressed, is that the shoes were probably expensive, or at least moderately priced, but a sentiment analysis tool would likely miss this subtlety. \\xa0\\nIdiomatic language\\nIdiomatic language, such as the use of—for example—common English phrases like “Let’s not beat around the bush,” or “Break a leg,” frequently confounds sentiment analysis tools and the ML algorithms that they’re built on. When human language phrases like the ones above are used on social media channels or in product reviews, sentiment analysis tools will either incorrectly identify them—the “break a leg” example could be incorrectly identified as something painful or sad, for example—or miss them completely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Open source vs. software as a service (SaaS) sentiment analysis tools\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nOrganizations who decide they want to deploy sentiment analysis to better understand their customers have two options for how they can go about it: either purchase an existing tool or build one of their own.\\nBusinesses opting to build their own tool typically use an open-source library in a common coding language such as Python or Java. These libraries are useful because their communities are steeped in data science. Still, organizations looking to take this approach will need to make a considerable investment in hiring a team of engineers and data scientists.\\nAcquiring an existing software as a service (SaaS) sentiment analysis tool requires less initial investment and allows businesses to deploy a pre-trained machine learning model rather than create one from scratch.

processing. The goal of sentiment analysis is to classify the text based on the mood or mentality expressed in the text, which can be positive negative, or neutral.\\nWhat is Sentiment Analysis?\\nSentiment analysis is the process of classifying whether a block of text is positive, negative, or neutral. The goal that Sentiment mining tries to gain is to be analysed people’s opinions in a way that can help businesses expand. It focuses not only on polarity (positive, negative & neutral) but also on emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.). It uses various Natural Language Processing algorithms such as Rule-based, Automatic, and Hybrid.\\nlet’s consider a scenario, if we want to analyze whether a product is satisfying customer requirements, or is there a need for this product in the market. We can use sentiment analysis to monitor that product’s reviews. Sentiment analysis is also efficient to use when there is a large set of unstructured data, and we want to classify that data by automatically tagging it. Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys are used extensively to gain knowledge of how a customer perceives a product or service. Sentiment analysis also gained popularity due to its feature to process large volumes of NPS responses and obtain consistent results quickly.\\nSentiment\\nWhy is Sentiment Analysis Important?\\nSentiment analysis is the contextual meaning of words that indicates the social sentiment of a brand and also helps the business to determine whether the product they are manufacturing is going to make a demand in the market or not.\\nAccording to the survey,80% of the world’s data is unstructured. The data needs to be analyzed and be in a structured manner whether it is in the form of emails, texts, documents, articles, and many more.\\n\\nSentiment Analysis is required as it stores data in an efficient, cost friendly.\\nSentiment analysis solves real-time issues and can help you solve all real-time scenarios.\\n\\nHere are some key reasons why sentiment analysis is important for business:\\n\\nCustomer Feedback Analysis: Businesses can analyze customer reviews, comments, and feedback to understand the sentiment behind them helping in identifying areas for improvement and addressing customer concerns, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.\\nBrand Reputation Management: Sentiment analysis allows businesses to monitor their brand reputation in real-time.By tracking mentions and sentiments on social media, review platforms, and other online channels, companies can respond promptly to both positive and negative sentiments, mitigating potential damage to their brand.\\nProduct Development and Innovation: Understanding customer sentiment helps identify features and aspects of their products or services that are well-received or need improvement. This information is invaluable for product development and innovation, enabling companies to align their offerings with customer preferences.\\nCompetitor Analysis: Sentiment Analysis can be used to compare the sentiment around a company’s products or services with those of competitors.Businesses identify their strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors, allowing for strategic decision-making.\\nMarketing Campaign EffectivenessBusinesses can evaluate the success of their marketing campaigns by analyzing the sentiment of online discussions and social media mentions. Positive sentiment indicates that the campaign is resonating with the target audience, while negative sentiment may signal the need for adjustments.\\n\\nWhat are the Types of Sentiment Analysis?\\nFine-Grained Sentiment Analysis\\nThis depends on the polarity base. This category can be designed as very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative. The rating is done on a scale of 1 to 5. If the rating is 5 then it is very positive, 2 then negative, and 3 then neutral.\\nEmotion detection\\nThe sentiments happy, sad, angry, upset, jolly, pleasant, and so on come under emotion detection. It is also known as a lexicon method of sentiment analysis.\\nAspect-Based Sentiment Analysis\\nIt focuses on a particular aspect for instance if a person wants to check the feature of the cell phone then it checks the aspect such as the battery, screen, and camera quality then aspect based is used.\\nMultilingual Sentiment Analysis\\nMultilingual consists of different languages where the classification needs to be done as positive, negative, and neutral. This is highly challenging and comparatively difficult.\\nHow does Sentiment Analysis work?\\nSentiment Analysis in NLP, is used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as a review, comment, or social media post.\\nThe goal is to identify whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. let’s understand the overview in general two steps:\\nPreprocessing\\nStarting with collecting the text data that needs to be analysed for sentiment like customer reviews, social media posts, news articles, or any other form of textual content. The collected text is pre-processed to clean and standardize the data with various tasks:\\n\\nRemoving irrelevant information (e.g., HTML tags, special characters).\\nTokenization: Breaking the text into individual words or tokens.\\nRemoving stop words (common words like “and,” “the,” etc. that don’t contribute much to sentiment).\\nStemming or Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form.\\n\\nAnalysis\\nText is converted for analysis using techniques like bag-of-words or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).Models are then trained with labeled datasets, associating text with sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). \\nAfter training and validation, the model predicts sentiment on new data, assigning labels based on learned patterns.\\nWhat are the Approaches to Sentiment Analysis?\\nThere are three main approaches used:\\nRule-based\\nOver here, the lexicon method, tokenization, and parsing come in the rule-based. The approach is that counts the number of positive and negative words in the given dataset. If the number of positive words is greater than the number of negative words then the sentiment is positive else vice-versa.\\nMachine Learning\\nThis approach works on the machine learning technique. Firstly, the datasets are trained and predictive analysis is done. The next process is the extraction of words from the text is done. This text extraction can be done using different techniques such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector machines, hidden Markov model, and conditional random fields like this machine learning techniques are used.\\nNeural Network\\nIn the last few years neural networks have evolved at a very rate. It involves using artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure of the human brain, to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. it has Recurrent neural networks, Long short-term memory, Gated recurrent unit, etc to process sequential data like text.\\nHybrid Approach\\nIt is the combination of two or more approaches i.e. rule-based and Machine Learning approaches. The surplus is that the accuracy is high compared to the other two approaches.\\nSentiment analysis Use Cases\\nSentiment Analysis has a wide range of applications as:\\nSocial Media\\nIf for instance the comments on social media side as Instagram, over here all the reviews are analyzed and categorized as positive, negative, and neutral.\\nNike Analyzing Instagram Sentiment for New Shoe Launch\\nNike, a leading sportswear brand, launched a new line of running shoes with the goal of reaching a younger audience. To understand user perception and assess the campaign’s effectiveness, Nike analyzed the sentiment of comments on its Instagram posts related to the new shoes.\\n\\nNike collected all comments from the past month on Instagram posts featuring the new shoes.\\nA sentiment analysis tool was used to categorize each comment as positive, negative, or neutral.\\n\\n\\nThe analysis revealed that 60% of comments were positive, 30% were neutral, and 10% were negative. Positive comments praised the shoes’ design, comfort, and performance. Negative comments expressed dissatisfaction with the price, fit, or availability.\\n\\nThe positive sentiment majority indicates that the campaign resonated well with the target audience. Nike can focus on amplifying positive aspects and addressing concerns raised in negative comments.\\n\\nCustomer Service\\nIn the play store, all the comments in the form of 1 to 5 are done with the help of sentiment analysis approaches.\\nPlay Store App Sentiment Analysis for Improved Customer Service\\nDuolingo, a popular language learning app, received a significant number of negative reviews on the Play Store citing app crashes and difficulty completing lessons. To understand the specific issues and improve customer service, Duolingo employed sentiment analysis on their Play Store reviews.\\n\\nDuolingo collected all app reviews on the Play Store over a specific time period.\\nEach review’s rating (1-5 stars) and text content were analyzed.\\nSentiment analysis tools categorized the text content as positive,\\xa0negative,\\xa0or neutral.\\n\\n\\nThe analysis revealed a correlation between lower star ratings and negative sentiment in the textual reviews. Common themes in negative reviews included app crashes,\\xa0difficulty progressing through lessons,\\xa0and lack of engaging content. Positive reviews praised the app’s effectiveness,\\xa0user interface,\\xa0and variety of languages offered.\\n\\nBy analyzing Play Store reviews’ sentiment, Duolingo identified and addressed customer concerns effectively. This resulted in a significant decrease in negative reviews and an increase in average star ratings. Additionally, Duolingo’s proactive approach to customer service improved brand image and user satisfaction.\\n\\nMarketing Sector\\nIn the marketing area where a particular product needs to be reviewed as good or bad.\\nAnalyzing Consumer Sentiment for Product Review in the Marketing Sector\\nA company launching a new line of organic skincare products needed to gauge consumer opinion before a major marketing campaign. To understand the potential market and identify areas for improvement, they employed sentiment analysis on social media conversations and online reviews mentioning the products.\\n\\nThe company collected social media posts and online reviews mentioning the new skincare line using relevant keywords and hashtags.\\nText analysis tools were used to clean and pre-process the data.\\nSentiment analysis algorithms categorized each text snippet as positive,\\xa0negative,\\xa0or neutral towards the product.\\n\\n\\nThe analysis revealed an overall positive sentiment towards the product,\\xa0with 70% of mentions being positive,\\xa020% neutral,\\xa0and 10% negative. Positive comments praised the product’s natural ingredients,\\xa0effectiveness,\\xa0and skin-friendly properties. Negative comments expressed dissatisfaction with the price,\\xa0packaging,\\xa0or fragrance.\\nThe bar graph clearly shows the dominance of positive sentiment towards the new skincare line. This indicates a promising market reception and encourages further investment in marketing efforts.\\nWhat are the challenges in Sentiment Analysis?\\nThere are major challenges in the sentiment analysis approach:\\n\\nIf the data is in the form of a tone, then it becomes really difficult to detect whether the comment is pessimist or optimistic.\\nIf the data is in the form of emoji, then you need to detect whether it is good or bad.\\nEven the ironic, sarcastic, comparing comments detection is really hard.\\nComparing a neutral statement is a big task.\\n\\nSentiment Analysis Vs Semantic Analysis\\nSentiment analysis and Semantic analysis are both natural language processing techniques, but they serve distinct purposes in understanding textual content.\\nSentiment Analysis\\nSentiment analysis focuses on determining the emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. Its primary goal is to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, especially valuable in understanding customer opinions, reviews, and social media comments. Sentiment analysis algorithms analyse the language used to identify the prevailing sentiment and gauge public or individual reactions to products, services, or events.\\nSemantic Analysis\\nSemantic analysis, on the other hand, goes beyond sentiment and aims to comprehend the meaning and context of the text. It seeks to understand the relationships between words, phrases, and concepts in a given piece of content. Semantic analysis considers the underlying meaning, intent, and the way different elements in a sentence relate to each other. This is crucial for tasks such as question answering, language translation, and content summarization, where a deeper understanding of context and semantics is required.\\nAlso Check: \\n\\nSentiment Analysis of Hindi Text – Python\\nFacebook Sentiment Analysis using python\\nTwitter Sentiment Analysis using Python\\nSentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\\nEmotion Detection using Bidirectional LSTM\\nSentiment Classification Using BERT\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, sentiment analysis is a crucial tool in deciphering the mood and opinions expressed in textual data, providing valuable insights for businesses and individuals alike. By classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral, sentiment analysis aids in understanding customer sentiments, improving brand reputation, and making informed business decisions.\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\nWhat is sentiment analysis using NLP?\\n\\n Sentiment analysis using NLP involves using natural language processing techniques to analyze and determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in textual data.\\n\\nWhich NLP model is best for sentiment analysis?\\n\\n The best model depends on the specific task and data. Commonly used models include BERT, GPT, and LSTM-based models.\\n\\nWhat are the three levels of sentiment analysis?\\n\\nThree levels are document-level, sentence-level, and aspect-level.
